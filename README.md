# Experiment-8
## Purpose: 
This document describes the software requirements and specification (SRS) for an automated
teller machine (ATM) network. The document is intended for the customer and the developer
(designers, testers, maintainers). The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of banking
accounts and account services. Knowledge and understanding of Unified Modeling Language
(UML) diagrams is also required. 

## Scope:
The software supports a computerized banking network called ‗Bank24„. The network
enables customers to complete simple bank account services via automated teller machines
(ATMs) that may be located off premise and that need not be owned and operated by the
customer’s bank. The ATM identifies a customer by a cash card and password. It collects
information about a simple account transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer, bill
payment), communicates the transaction information to the customer’s bank, and dispenses
cash to the customer. The banks provide their own software for their own computers. The
‗Bank24„ software requires appropriate record keeping and security provisions. The
Software must handle concurrent accesses to the same account correctly. 

## Intended Audience:
The intended audience of this SRS consists of:

□ Software designers

□ Systems engineers

□ Software developers

□ Software testers

□ Customers

The actors of the system are:

1. User

2. ATM Machine

3. Bank
